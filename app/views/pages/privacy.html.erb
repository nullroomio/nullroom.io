      <h3 class="text-md font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Our Privacy Philosophy</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        At nullroom.io, our mission is to provide a "volatile space" for conversation
        without a digital footprint. We believe that privacy is not just about hiding data
        it is about the intentional non-existence of data.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-md font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <b>Personal Info:</b> No names, emails, phone numbers, or accounts.<br>
        <b>Message Content:</b> Messages are encrypted on your device and never travel through our servers in a readable format.<br>
        <b>IP Addresses:</b> Server logs are disabled for all room paths.<br>
        <b>Cookies:</b> No tracking or advertising cookies.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-md font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Data We Process Temporarily</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <b>Room UUIDs:</b> Stored in volatile memory (Redis) and purged after 30 minutes.<br>
        <b>Signaling Metadata:</b> Encrypted connection details are relayed during the handshake and never stored.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-md font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Security Architecture</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <b>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):</b> Powered by the <b>Web Crypto API</b>.<br>
        <b>Peer-to-Peer (P2P):</b> Data travels directly via <b>WebRTC</b>.<br>
        <b>Client-Side Keys:</b> The key is in the URL fragment (`#`), which is never sent to our servers.

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <b>Relays:</b> We use STUN/TURN (Cloudflare) for NAT traversal; they only see routing data, not content.<br>
        <b>Payments:</b> Handled by Stripe via a "Blind Token" system to decouple identity from chat.

          Why nullroom over other encrypted messaging apps?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          <b>Traditional Apps:</b> Require you to install an app, verify a phone number, and create an account. You become a permanent contact in someone's database—even if you only wanted a one-time conversation.
          <br><br>
          <b>nullroom.io:</b> No app, no sign-up, no phone number, no account. Just click "Create Room", share a URL, and chat. The moment you close the tab, everything vanishes. Perfect for temporary conversations where onboarding friction would be a dealbreaker.

          What is "Zero-Trace" messaging?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          Most messaging apps store your history on their servers, even if it's encrypted. nullroom.io is designed to leave no trace:
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>No Accounts: We don't ask for your name, email, or phone number.</li>
            <li>No Logs: Our servers are configured to ignore connection details, meaning there is no record of who you talked to or when.</li>
            <li>No Persistence: Messages live only in your browser's temporary memory. Once you close the tab, that data is wiped forever.</li>
          </ul>

          How does the security work?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          We use two core browser technologies to keep you safe:
          <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
            <li>WebRTC (Peer-to-Peer): This technology allows your device to talk directly to your friend's device. Instead of your messages traveling through our servers, they take the most direct path across the internet.</li>
            <li>Web Crypto API: Before a message leaves your device, it is "locked" using a digital key that only your friend possesses. This is known as End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="p-2 bg-gray-900 rounded cursor-pointer">
        <summary class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-100 hover:text-blue-400">
          If you don't have the keys, who does?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          Only you and your peer.
          When you create a room, your browser generates a secret key.
          This key is appended to the URL after the # symbol.
          Because of how browsers work, anything after the # is never sent to the server.
          This means we never see your key, so we can never read your messages - even if we wanted to.
        </p>

        <summary class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-100 hover:text-blue-400">
          How long are rooms available?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          By default, rooms are strictly ephemeral and expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
          Our Redis-backed "self-destruct" timer ensures that once the room expires, the signaling data is permanently purged from our volatile memory.

          How many users can chat in a room?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          nullroom is optimized for private, 1-on-1 conversations; therefore, each room is limited to two participants.
          Our backend enforces a "Room Capacity Lock" to prevent third parties from joining an active session.

          Can I access a room from multiple devices?
        </summary>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          No. Because the encryption key is generated locally and stored in your browser's URL fragment (#), it never leaves your device.
          To keep the "Zero Trace" promise, the key is not synced to any cloud service; you must have the specific URL with the fragment on the device you wish to use.
